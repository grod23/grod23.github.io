Hi, I am a computer science major at California State University, Fullerton and I plan on graduating in 2026. 

## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 3, Part 1
  
  I liked this lab because this is where I really started to get the hang of programming functions for specific use cases, utilizing the terminal, and debugging. The labs became much more enjoyable when I really started to understand what I was typing and why. 

* Lab 4, part 2
  
  This lab was enjoyable because I got to program a guessing game that I could play on my own. Althought the Hi-Lo guessing game was simple in its nature, it was really interesting to program the workings of thee game as well as determining a winner or a loser.

* Lab 6, part 2
  
  This lab was my most favorite as I am a very big fan of the game of blackjack. This lab taught me how to implement the rules of the game in an intuitive way which turned out to be pretty fun as well. It was a challenge programming the rules of the Ace card but once I got it down, it made a lot more sense.
